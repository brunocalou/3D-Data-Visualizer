3D-Data-Visualizer
==================

Simple program made to get points from a file and draw it in 3D on the screen

The main purpose of this program is to get gps data from somewhere and plot the result with opengl

==================
Dependencies
==================

The freeglut library is current needed for this project, but I'll change the code in order to work with opengl provided by Qt

For now, to run it on linux, install the freeglut3-dev library

sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
